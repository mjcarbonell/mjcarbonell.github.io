Players can explore a vast and intricately designed world, encountering formidable enemies, discovering hidden treasures, and uncovering the secrets of the game's lore.

			ParkMe functions as an urban parking solution, addressing the challenge of parking in a big city with a concept similar to Airbnb. ParkMe allows individuals to lease their available parking spaces. The application was developed using Flutter to ensure compatibility across devices, supported by Node.js and Express. TypeScript was employed for enhanced clarity and organization, while Postgres managed the data. GitHub served as the code repository, Discord facilitated communication among my team, and task management was streamlined through Jira.
