		<p>
			I developed a game called Operation: Joust in Unity. I used unique polygon shapes created in Blender, resulting in smooth performance. The gameplay involves small-scale combat against turrets that track the player and launch spikes at them. While battling turrets, you navigate through the vast river until you reach the end. Itâ€™s still in development as I am adding better UI, enemies, and customization to the game.
